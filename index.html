            <p>This survey, authored by Aske Plaat, Max van Duijn, Niki van Stein, Mike Preuss, Peter van der Putten, and Kees Joost Batenburg at Leiden University, explores the emerging landscape of agentic large language models (LLMs) that reason, act, and interact. It provides a structured taxonomy and an extensive review of state-of-the-art research in the field.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        There is great interest in agentic LLMs, large language models that act as agents. We review
the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda.
        
Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature
according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, re-
flection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action
models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses
on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study
emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories:
retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all
categories.
        
We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important
applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-
reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific
research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running
out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can
keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM
assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.
